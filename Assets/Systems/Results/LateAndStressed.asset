  ResultText: Emily arrived late to work, frustrated by the obstacles in her home.
    Each barrier added precious minutes to her morning routine, causing her to start
    the day already stressed and flustered. The frustration carried over into her
    workday, affecting her focus and productivity. Emily struggled to concentrate
    and complete tasks, making it a particularly difficult and unproductive day at
    work.
